# 2017 Offseason

Currently being used for offseason Cosmos development.

Uses [NerdyDrive](https://github.com/tedklin/NerdyDrive) drive subsystem and [2017Steamworks](https://github.com/nerdherd/Steamworks2017) gear intake subsystem (might re-implement the gear intake subsystem for training later).
